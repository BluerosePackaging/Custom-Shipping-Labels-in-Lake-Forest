## What Are Custom Shipping Labels?

Custom shipping labels are printed adhesive labels that contain shipment details like destination, tracking information, barcodes, and branding elements. While standard labels simply carry data, customized labels are tailored to fit your workflow, packaging style, and product type.

At Bluerose Packaging, we design and produce shipping labels in a wide range of formats—whether you need thermal labels for high-speed fulfillment or branded stickers to enhance unboxing appeal.

## Types of Labels Available

We supply custom shipping labels suited for a variety of applications, including:

- Direct thermal and thermal transfer labels  
- Barcode and QR code labels  
- Preprinted branded shipping labels  
- Waterproof and weather-resistant options  
- Color-coded labels for sorting and inventory  
- Tamper-evident or security seals  

Labels are available in rolls or sheets, with custom shapes, sizes, and adhesives depending on your packaging surface and handling conditions.

## Why Custom Labels Matter

Custom shipping labels can improve more than just appearance—they serve as critical tools in your packaging and logistics system. With properly tailored labels, your business can:

- Reduce picking and packing errors
